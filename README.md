# component

This is a fork of Stuart Sierra's [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) library
that builds for both Clojure and ClojureScript - do not contact Stuart about this; I am
maintaining the ClojureScript library.

[Leiningen] dependency information:

    [quile/component "0.2.2"]

**NOTE:** There's a bad release on clojars with version 0.2.3.  Don't try to use it.


# Thanks

I was able to use the excellent [node test runner](https://github.com/mike-thompson-day8/cljsbuild-none-test-seed) from https://github.com/mike-thompson-day8/cljsbuild-none-test-seed - thanks for this!
